          <p>
            We believe in digital stonemasonry – the art of crafting websites with architectural precision, 
            tactile interactions, and minimalist luxury. Our philosophy bridges the gap between mass-produced 
            templates and costly custom development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every blueprint we create follows principles of structural integrity, aesthetic harmony, 
            and functional excellence. We serve technically proficient developers, small agencies, 
            startups, and skilled entrepreneurs who demand premium quality without enterprise pricing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design system draws inspiration from the finest materials – quarried stone palettes, 
            fluid typography scales, and interaction patterns that feel as natural as running your 
            hand along polished marble.
